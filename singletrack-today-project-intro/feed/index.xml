					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the feedback and compliment!  Sorry for the delay in replying - the comment notification email I got went to my spam folder.  Site is new and I&#039;m still working out the bugs so not surprised you found one.  I tried looking in IE but I couldn&#039;t find anything overlapping.  Do you recall elements were overlapping?  If so, please let me know.  Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Howdy, I do believe your website could possibly be having browser compatibility problems.
When I look at your site in Safari, it looks fine however,
when opening in Internet Explorer, it has some overlapping issues.
I simply wanted to provide you with a quick heads up! Apart 
from that, fantastic site!]]></description>
